Whether you remember your dreams or not, do a sand tray or not, the events and details of your life provide plenty of material for our work together.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While I am the expert in theory and interventions, you are the expert on yourself and your life.
